# Codeless-ML
This is for Machine Learning beginners or ML entusiasts to fatsen their model making process without writing codes.
This can be also used to compares the outputs given by different algorithms and techniques.

## Benifits
This means that we can finally spend less time:

1. dealing with data preprocessing for different data types ☠️
2.  meshing different model architectures just to get simple baseline models
3.  writing code to make predictions

## Highlights:
- flexible interface
- real time data comparison

## Language
- Python 

## Usages
- Modern data processing and artficial learning in robotics and programming segment
